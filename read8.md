# USING COMPARISON OPERATORS :
## At the most basic level,
## you can evaluate two variables using acomparison operator to return a t rue or f alse value. 

# loops 
## loops check acondition,if it return true,acode block ill run.
## example:
## for (var i=0;i<10;1++){
## document.write(i);
## }

# USING FOR LOOPS
## A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array. 
## In this example, the scores for each round of a test are stored in an array called scores. 
## The total number of items in the array is stored in a variable called arrayl ength. 
## This number is obtained using the l ength property of the array. 

# USING WHILE LOOPS
## Here is an example of awhile loop.
## var i = l ; var msg = ' ' ; 
## // Set counter to 1 II Message 
## //Store 5 times tabl e in a variable 
## while (i < 10) { 
## msg += i + ' x 5 = ' + (i * 5) + '<br I>'; i++; 
## }
## document.getEl ementByid( ' answer') . innerHTML = msg; 

## It writes out the 5 times table.
## Each time the loop is run, another calculation is written into the variable called msg. 
## This loop will continue to run for as long as the condition in the parentheses is true.
## That condition is a counter indicating that, as long as the variable i remains less than 10, 
## the statements in the subsequent code block should run.
