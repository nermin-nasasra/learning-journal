# HTML5 LAYOUT
* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.

* The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).

* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.

* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
