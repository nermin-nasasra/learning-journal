# Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript language itself, you need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in three sections: 
## A:What is a script and how do i create one?
## B:How do computers fit in with the world around them? 
## C:How do I write a script for a web page?

# EXPRESSIONS:
## An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
## OPERATORS:Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 
## ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers. You may remember some from math class.


# functions

## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
## Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

## declaring a function

## function sayHello() {
## document.write('hello!');
